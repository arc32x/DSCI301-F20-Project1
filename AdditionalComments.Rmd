It might be interesting to look at say, the top types by the most common countries in the data set.  Many countries actually have a smallish sample:

```{r}
count(netflix, country) %>% 
  filter(n > 80) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```{r}
netflix %>%
  filter(! is.na(country)) %>%      # drop those NAs
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(n() > 80) %>%              # get the common countries
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot() + 
    geom_bar(aes(x = type), position="dodge") + 
    facet_wrap(~country)
```

We can see some like South Korea and Japan where the TV is a little higher.
